If you want to contribute to the project, you can fix the Issues from https://github.com/Dan149/Tom-assistant/issues and add new features that would suit with the goal of the program, like a GUI or more answers for the chat() function.
You can also fix bugs and errors, or improve the security when it will be necessary.
If you find critical security breach, please contact me on this mail: **danfaldev@gmail.com**.

**When you publish a modified version of the program, please remove the code l17 "uploaded by the official github project owner", instead, you can write "uploaded by a github contributor".**
